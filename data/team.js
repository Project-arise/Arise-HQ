  bio: "Engineering undergraduate working across robotics, IoT, automation, and system integration. Founder of Project ARISE, focused on building real prototypes through experimentation, teamwork, and iteration.",

  detailedBio: "Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science & IoT, with a diploma background in Automobile Engineering. I work hands-on across robotics, IoT systems, electronics, mechanical design, and basic software. My journey has been chaotic—multiple projects, competitions, hackathons, leadership roles, and failed attempts—but driven by a constant need to build real systems rather than stay in theory. And founded Project ARISE by bringing together people from different disciplines, with the long-term goal of building an assistant robot capable of emotional intelligence for mental support and physical assistance. Still learning, still building, still under construction.",
